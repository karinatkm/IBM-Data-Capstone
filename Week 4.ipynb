One of the favourite go-to desserts/drinks of the younger Asian population is boba, also known as bubble tea. From my experience living in Los Angeles, it is not always easy to get boba if you do not live in \"Asian neighborhoods\". With poor public transportation and a driving culture, getting bubble tea could be a 30-minute or longer venture. Therefore, there are opportunities to open more boba shops in Los Angeles where they are not already saturated. \n\n"

This will give a preliminary view on where new bubble tea shops could thrive!"

The target audience of this analysis will be these individuals who want to open a new location for these bubble tea franchises but are wondering what a good location would be."
